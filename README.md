# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms
# Shortest Job First 


Shortest Job First included in the repo contains string comparision to avoid 
modification of already modified values when multiple processes hold same burst time


An alternate Approach instead of using stringstream is available in the repo that uses an integer array to keep track of indices
that are modified

# Priority Scheduling

Priority for processes in the waiting queue changes at the rate of 2
Priority for the processes in execution changes at the rate of 1
Time Slice is 1
